# MOIA-D-SU
Since this code runs on PlatEMO platform, it is necessary to download MATLAB software and the version after PlatEMO-2020. 

The download address is: https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO. 

Then place the MOIA/D-SU folder in the PlatEMO\Algorithms\Multi-objective optimization path. 

In addition, replace ALGORITHM.m and Sparse_FS.m in PlatEMO with ALGORITHM.m and Sparse_FS.m in the MOIA/D-SU folder.

Finally, just run the platemo.m file in PlatEMO.
